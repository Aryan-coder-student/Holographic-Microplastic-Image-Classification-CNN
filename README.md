# Holographic-Microplastic-Image-Classification-CNN

This dataset contains microplastic particle images used for research purposes, including 'Holographic Classifier: 
Deep Learning in Digital Holography for Automatic Micro-objects Classification' and 'Microplastic pollution 
monitoring with holographic classification and deep learning.' The dataset is labeled by microplastic type and 
number of particles in the image.
